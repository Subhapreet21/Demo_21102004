##JavaScript##

1)Static Websites: These pages are created with fixed content that is the same for all users. They are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and don't use a database or server-side scripting languages. Static pages are good for projects with infrequent content changes, like a small business's online brochure. Ex: Facebook login page

2)Dynamic websites: These pages can change based on the user, the time, or other factors. They are built using back-end code and server-side languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, or server-side JavaScript. Dynamic pages are designed for continuous content management, like a news portal. Ex: YouTube recommendations, Google maps, Cricbuzz(scores)

Variables:
-Used to store data/values/literals
-Variables are used to store the data
-They can store any kind of data
-While taking the same variable names, the latest value will be considered
-Variables can start with letters,_,$(For JS)
-Variables can't start with numbers
-Variables can include letters, numbers,_,$
-Variables are Case sensitive
-Space between two variables are not allowed

Types of variables:
1)var :- Redeclaration and reinitialization possible
2)let :- Only reinitialization possible
3)const :- Both are not possible

Ex:
var username="Rakesh"
console.log(username);

Here-->var:-variable
       username:-identifier(Name given for the memory block)
       Rakesh:-value/data
   
-Extension of JavaScript file:-  .js

*In the browser, if we want to run javascript file or css file we must connect those files with html file.*

consol.log(): It is a method to print the output in the developer console
document.writeln(): It is a method used to print the output on the UI

Q) What is a comment?
A)
-Comments are the ignored lines by the browser
-To give information to the developer

#Types:
html: <!-- hjadsb,k --!>

            Multi-line: /**/

Q) What is a data type?
A)
-Used to specify what kind of data is stored in the variable.

#Types:
1) Primitive data types:-
-They are built-in
-They are immutable
-They can store only a single value
	-String
	-Number
	-Boolean
	-Undefined
	-Null
	-Symbol
	-bigint

##String
-It is a sequence of characters enclosed within "", '', ``(template literals/backticks)

##Number
-Range: -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 . Upto this range we consider as number data type. Beyond this range it will be bigint.

##Boolean(True/False)

##Undefined: Variables are declared but not initialized with the value

##Null: Empty value or the absence of an object
-Return type of null is 'object'

##bigint: Any value exceeding the range of number data type/ Any value suffixed with n

##Symbol


2) Non-Primitive data types:-
-They are user defined
-They are mutable
-They can store multiple values
	-Object(math, date, json)
	-Array
	-Functions
